# EELE 465 - Microcontroller Applications

## Introduction

EELE 465 is a course offered by Montana State University for Electrical and Computer Engineers. I took this class Spring 2021 in a hybrid format. Please refer to the Syllabus for a more concrete format of the class.

The main objective of this class was to get a better understanding of the microprocessor we were using - the **MSP430-FR2355** - and develop engineering skills. This includes completing a project in the given time frame using applicable datasheets and debugging tactics, while also translating our work in writing to communicate the main points of our work to our _manager_ (in this case our professor).

## Format

Each folder represents a project that was completed between one to four weeks. There also exists a memo in each directory to summarize the project with the following format:

- Summary of the project
- Hardware setup
- Various steps taken to complete the project
- Conclusion
- Lessons learned
- Figures and diagrams to visualize hardware circuitry and results

## Programming Languages and Concepts

The main concept that touches each project was the **I2C** protocol. Each application utilizes this communication protocol to achieve some functionality. This signifies that code for both the master and slave devices had to be developed.

As for the language, we used assembly for the first few projects and transitioned to C in later projects.
